* Since the model is trained on google colab (we don't have that money to buy a GPU)
* All train code is written on colab, you can view it, but I have to **WARN** you that it is not decently written
* We have not run it, we just downloaded it as a .py
* Also, an original notebook file is provided just in case you need it...
